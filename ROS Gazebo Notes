1. Clone Git repo with basic RRBot code
- cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ROS
- git clone https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_demos.git
2. Building a catkin workspace and sourcing the setup file
- cd ~/catkin_ws
- catkin_make

Running Sample example:
In current terminal (Rviz)
- cd ~/catkin_ws
- source ./devel/setup.bash
- roslaunch rrbot_description rrbot_rviz.launch

In a new terminal (Gazebo):
- cd ~/catkin_ws
- source ./devel/setup.bash
- roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch

In a new terminal (ROS Control):
- cd ~/catkin_ws
- source ./devel/setup.bash
- roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch

Example of Moving Joints (Gazebo):
rostopic pub /rrbot/joint1_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 1.2"
rostopic pub /rrbot/joint2_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: -0.9"

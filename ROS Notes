When starting a new ROS project
1. Creating a ROS Package: http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage
- Create the new package in the Workspace
  cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ROS
- Create the package named "turtletests"
  catkin_create_pkg turtletests std_msgs rospy roscpp

2. Building a catkin workspace and sourcing the setup file
- cd ~/catkin_ws
- catkin_make

3. Check the created package dependencies
- rospack depends1 turtletests

4. Examining the Simple Publisher and Subscriber
- roscore
- cd ~/catkin_ws
- source ./devel/setup.bash

- rosrun basic_scripts talker.py
- rosrun basic_scripts listener.py

- rosrun basic_scripts counterPublisher.py
- rosrun basic_scripts counterListener.py
